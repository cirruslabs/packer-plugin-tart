# Tart Builder

Type: `tart`

The `tart` builder is used to create macOS and Linux VMs for Apple Silicon powered by [Tart](https://tart.run/).

Make sure you have followed the [installation instructions](/packer/integrations/cirruslabs/tart#installation) before continuing.

## Example Usage

Here is a basic example of creating a macOS virtual machine:

```hcl
variable "macos_version" {
  type =  string
  default = "ventura"
}

source "tart-cli" "tart" {
  vm_base_name = "${var.macos_version}-vanilla"
  vm_name      = "${var.macos_version}-base"
  cpu_count    = 4
  memory_gb    = 8
  disk_size_gb = 50
  ssh_username = "admin"
  ssh_password = "admin"
  ssh_timeout  = "120s"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.tart-cli.tart"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["echo 'Disabling spotlight indexing...'", "sudo mdutil -a -i off"]
  }

  # more provisioners
}
```

For more advanced examples, please refer to the [`example/` directory](https://github.com/cirruslabs/packer-plugin-tart/tree/main/example) and the [macOS](https://github.com/cirruslabs/macos-image-templates) and [Linux](https://github.com/cirruslabs/linux-image-templates) Packer templates for [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/).


## Configuration Reference

- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the VM to create (only when `from_ipsw`, `from_iso` or `vm_base_name` are used) and run.

#### Optional:

- `allow_insecure` (boolean) — When cloning the image, connect to the OCI registry via an insecure HTTP protocol.
- `pull_concurrency` (boolean) — Amount of layers to pull concurrently from an OCI registry when pulling the image. Default is 4 for Tart 2.0.0+.
- `cpu_count` (number) - Amount of virtual CPUs to use for the new VM. Overrides `tart create` default value when using `from_ipsw` and `from_iso` and VM settings when using `vm_base_name`.
- `create_grace_time` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") — Time to wait after finishing the installation process. Can be used to work around the issue when Virtualization.Framework's installation process is still running in the background for some time after `tart create` had already finished.
- `disk_size_gb` — Disk size in GB to use for the new VM. Overrides `tart create` default value when using `from_ipsw` and `from_iso` and VM settings when using `vm_base_name`.
- `recovery_partition` (string) — Behavior with the respect to the macOS recovery partition. Set to `"delete"` to delete it (allows for disk resize, decreases the VM image size, but prevents the updates from working), `"keep"` to keep it as is (prevents the disk resize, increases the VM image size, but allows the updates to proceed) or `"relocate"` to move the partition to the end of disk (allows for disk resize, increases the VM image size, but allows the updates to proceed). Defaults to `""` which is currently equivalent to `"delete"`, but this may change in the future.
- `display` (string) — VM display resolution in a format of `<width>x<height>` (e.g. `1200x800`) to use for the new VM. Overrides `tart create` default value when using `from_ipsw` and `from_iso` and VM settings when using `vm_base_name`.
- `from_ipsw` (string) - Location of an IPSW file to initialize a macOS virtual machine from. Can be either an absolute path to a file on disk, URL to fetch a remote file or `latest`. Mutually exclusive with `from_iso` and `vm_base_name`.
- `from_iso` (list(string)) - Location of the ISO files to initialize a Linux virtual machine from. All values should represent an absolute path to a file on disk. Mutually exclusive with `from_ipsw` and `vm_base_name`.
- `headless` (bool) - Whether to show graphics interface of a VM. Useful for debugging the `boot_command`.
- `memory_gb` (number) - Amount of unified memory in GB to use for the new VM. Overrides `tart create` default value when using `from_ipsw` and `from_iso` and VM settings when using `vm_base_name`.
- `recovery` (bool) — Whether to boot the VM in recovery mode. Useful for disabling the System Integrity Protection automatically for the already created VMs.
- `rosetta` (string) - Whether to enable Rosetta support of a Linux guest VM. Useful for running non-arm64 binaries in the guest VM. A common used value is `rosetta`, for further details and explanation run `tart run --help`.
- `run_extra_args` (list(string)) - Extra arguments to pass to `tart run` command. For example, you can enable bridged networking by specifying `--net-bridged=en0`.
- `ip_extra_args` (list(string)) - Extra arguments to pass to `tart ip` command. For example, you can use a different resolver in case of bridged network by specifying `--resolver=arp`.
- `vm_base_name` (string) - The name of the VM to be used for the initial cloning. Can be either a local VM or a remote VM that will be pulled from a registry. Mutually exclusive with `from_ipsw` and `from_iso`.

### SSH connection configuration

- `ssh_username` (string) - Username to use for the communication over SSH to run provision steps.
- `ssh_password` (string) - Password to use for the communication over SSH to run provision steps.

### HTTP server configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/multistep/commonsteps/HTTPConfig.mdx'

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/multistep/commonsteps/HTTPConfig-not-required.mdx'

### Boot configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig.mdx'

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig-not-required.mdx'

### VNC configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig.mdx'

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig-not-required.mdx'
